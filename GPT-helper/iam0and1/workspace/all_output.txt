Based on the requirements, here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `CommandReader` class:
   - `read_last_commands()` method: Reads the last 10 commands from the `.bash_history` file.

2. `BugBountyToolReader` class:
   - `read_bug_bounty_tools()` method: Reads the bug bounty tools from the `commands.json` file.

3. `OpenAIAPIClient` class:
   - `send_commands_and_tools(commands, tools)` method: Sends the commands and bug bounty tools to the OpenAI API and retrieves the suggested commands.

4. `Clipboard` class:
   - `copy_to_clipboard(text)` method: Copies the selected command to the clipboard.

Now, let's proceed with creating the necessary files.

**command_reader.py**
```python
import os

class CommandReader:
    @staticmethod
    def read_last_commands():
        home_dir = os.path.expanduser("~")
        history_file = os.path.join(home_dir, ".bash_history")
        with open(history_file, "r") as file:
            lines = file.readlines()
            last_commands = lines[-10:]
        return last_commands
```

**bug_bounty_tool_reader.py**
```python
import json

class BugBountyToolReader:
    @staticmethod
    def read_bug_bounty_tools():
        with open("commands.json", "r") as file:
            tools = json.load(file)
        return tools
```

**openai_api_client.py**
```python
import os
import openai

class OpenAIAPIClient:
    def __init__(self):
        self.api_key = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
        openai.api_key = self.api_key

    def send_commands_and_tools(self, commands, tools):
        prompt = "Act as a bug bounty hunter and help me find bugs on my website. Suggest next 10 commands that I should run based on the last 10 commands and the list of tools provided."
        context = "\n".join(commands)
        data = {
            "prompt": prompt,
            "context": context,
            "tools": tools
        }
        response = openai.Completion.create(
            engine="davinci-codex",
            prompt=data["prompt"],
            max_tokens=100,
            context=data["context"],
            tools=data["tools"]
        )
        suggested_commands = response.choices[0].text.strip().split("\n")
        return suggested_commands
```

**clipboard.py**
```python
import pyperclip

class Clipboard:
    @staticmethod
    def copy_to_clipboard(text):
        pyperclip.copy(text)
```

**main.py**
```python
from command_reader import CommandReader
from bug_bounty_tool_reader import BugBountyToolReader
from openai_api_client import OpenAIAPIClient
from clipboard import Clipboard

def main():
    # Read last commands
    command_reader = CommandReader()
    last_commands = command_reader.read_last_commands()

    # Read bug bounty tools
    tool_reader = BugBountyToolReader()
    bug_bounty_tools = tool_reader.read_bug_bounty_tools()

    # Send commands and tools to OpenAI API
    openai_client = OpenAIAPIClient()
    suggested_commands = openai_client.send_commands_and_tools(last_commands, bug_bounty_tools)

    # Display suggested commands
    print("Suggested Commands:")
    for i, command in enumerate(suggested_commands, start=1):
        print(f"{i}. {command}")

    # Select and copy a command to clipboard
    selected_command = input("Select a command number to copy to clipboard: ")
    if selected_command.isdigit() and int(selected_command) in range(1, len(suggested_commands) + 1):
        Clipboard.copy_to_clipboard(suggested_commands[int(selected_command) - 1])
        print("Command copied to clipboard!")
    else:
        print("Invalid command number.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**requirements.txt**
```

```

Make sure to replace the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable with your actual OpenAI API key.

This architecture includes all the necessary components to read the last 10 commands, read bug bounty tools from a JSON file, send the commands and tools to the OpenAI API, receive and display the suggested commands, and allow the user to select and copy a command to the clipboard.
