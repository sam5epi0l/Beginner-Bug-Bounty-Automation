Based on the requirements, here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `CommandReader` class:
   - `read_last_commands()` method: Reads the last 10 commands from the `.bash_history` file.

2. `BugBountyToolReader` class:
   - `read_bug_bounty_tools()` method: Reads the bug bounty tools from the `commands.json` file.

3. `OpenAIAPIClient` class:
   - `send_commands_and_tools(commands, tools)` method: Sends the commands and bug bounty tools to the OpenAI API and retrieves the suggested commands.

4. `Clipboard` class:
   - `copy_to_clipboard(text)` method: Copies the selected command to the clipboard.

Now, let's proceed with creating the necessary files.
